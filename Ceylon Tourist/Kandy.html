            <h3>KANDY IS SRI LANKAâ€™S SECOND LARGEST CITY AFTER COLOMBO,

                 AND OLD-WORLD CHARM.</h3>

            <h3>Travel to Kandy</h3>
            <p>Lush forests, sprawling mountain ranges, the meandering Kandy Lake, known as the Sea of Milk,
                and an array of distinguished colonial building and magnificent Kandyan inspired 
               architecture completes this Medieval City. This beautiful, laidback capital is only 
               72 miles (115 kilometres) inland yet boasts exceptional cultural and historical
                attractions, set amidst forested hills. Known as a pilgrimage destination for 
               the Temple of the Tooth Relic (a sacred tooth of the Buddha), a listed UNESCO 
               World Heritage Site, Kandy is a sacred city, due to the importance and spiritual 
               significance of this temple. It is also known for the vibrantly festive Kandy
                Esala Perahera, also known as the Festival of the Tooth, an important 10-day 
               religious celebration each August. Lying at an altitude of 1 640 feet (500 metres)
                above sea level and surrounded by the Knuckles and Hunnasgiriya Mountain Ranges,
                the temperatures around Kandy are slightly cooler and conditions more pleasant
                than in the lowlands. An important and established Buddhist site, Kandy was
                formerly known as the city of Senkadagalapura. It served as the last capital 
               of the Sinhalese kingdom before falling to the British in 1815.</p>

Nilaveli Beach is a broad, sandy beach, lined with palm trees and dotted with fishermen's 
boats. Located on the northeast part of Sri Lanka, it's a 30-minute drive from the city of
 Trincomalee. This tiny island has calm beaches with gentle surf due to its own small reef.
 Although the beach at Nilaveli is large, it is popular with both locals and tourists.
 There are lifeguards on duty and many little restaurants along the beach,
 most specializing in seafood.The Anilana Nilaveli(link) sits right on Nilaveli Beach

This mile-long beach on Pasikuda Bay is perfect for swimming and wading.
 The surf is gentle, protected by a reef, unlike many beaches in Sri Lanka with rough surf.
 The water is also shallow, allowing you to walk out into the ocean for hundreds of yards. 
The sand is bright white and soft, with fine grains, and the beach is lined with coconut 
trees. This area is just starting to be discovered for luxury resort development, 
so there is plenty of untouched beach to explore.
For those who want a secluded getaway right on the water's edge, Karpaha Sands(link)

Arugam Bay is dramatically beautiful, with bright white sand 
and deep blue water gradually becoming green the closer you get to the shore. 
With that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks in Sri Lanka, and the beach 
is known as an international surf destination.Right on Arugam Bay, 
The Spice Trail (link)is a cool, little luxury resort with individual villa accommodations

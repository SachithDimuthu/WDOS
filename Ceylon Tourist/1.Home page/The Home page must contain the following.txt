why srilanka is the best place to travel
If golden beaches, rising waves, misty mountains, mighty elephants, stealthy leopards, 
giant whales, a majestic past, lovely tea and warm smiles could sum up a country,
 that would be Sri Lanka.

With many sites and scenes bottled up in to a small island,
 a traveller could be riding the waves in the dawn and admiring the green carpeted mountains
 by dusk. Travel destinations in Sri Lanka provide an array of holiday experience 
from sun kissed beach holidays to a marathon of wildlife watching, 
adrenaline pumping adventure sports and pilgrimage to some of the oldest cities in the world.

The smiles and hospitality of Sri Lanka are world famous and so are its spicy food,
 exotic fruits, and an array of sweetmeats found nowhere in the world. With so many cultures
 living next to each other life in Sri Lanka continues among a series of
 festivities throughout the year, an ideal recipe for fun and leisure

When is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?

It may sound cliched but Sri Lanka is genuinely a year-round holiday destination,
 although the best time to go to Sri Lanka is between December and mid-April, 
which is considered to be the peak season.(https://www.selectiveasia.com/sri-lanka-holidays/weather#:~:text=It%20may%20sound%20cliched%20but,to%20be%20the%20peak%20season.)

In a nutshell, the variations in the weather patterns mean that the best time to 
visit Sri Lanka is intertwined with where on the island you want to go:

If you’re heading to the west, or south coasts and the hill country, then you’re 
best off going between December and March.

If you’re intending to make your way to the east coast and the north you’ll
 find the best time of year to visit Sri Lankais from April or May to September.

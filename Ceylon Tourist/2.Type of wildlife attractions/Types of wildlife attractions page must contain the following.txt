*suitable content about wild life
Having 29.9 % of the country being declared as protected forests and with 26 national parks,
 10 Nature Reserves including 3 Strict Nature Reserves and 61 Sanctuaries, what Sri Lanka
 offers in wildlife, in terms of diversity, variety and the potential to experience 
(within shorter distances and time span) is almost unreal but incredibly true.

The island is home to a wide range of rich and absorbing wildlife, 
including Sri Lanka’s big five: the Elephant, Leopard, Sloth Bear,
 Blue Whale, and the Sperm Whale. Our forests are a treasure trove 
of bird species and Sri Lanka is among the countries that possess 
the highest endemism in the world.

2.description
The Asian elephant density in Sri Lanka is approximately ten times that of any other
 country. 10% of the world’s Asia elephant population live in this small island, hence,
 Sri Lanka offers opportunities of observing Asian elephants in the wild that are 
unparalleled elsewhere. The elephants have become a cultural icon of 
Sri Lanka.

2.description
The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most secretive and 
elusive of the large carnivores, and also the shrewdest. Pound for pound, 
it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable of killing 
prey far larger than itself

2.description-The sloth bear, the only member of Family Ursidae in Sri Lanka
 is found in dry zone forest habitats. Shaggy, dusty, and untidy black coat is 
an unmistakable to spot Sloth Bear. It is solitary by nature and emits noisy grunts 
and snorts while walking by keeping its nose closer to the ground in search of 
insects and fresh fruit.

2.description-Sri Lanka’s location, marine topography with deep ocean canyons and 
weather systems has created very hospitable conditions for Blue Whales to live in 
our waters.  Narrow continental shelf, average of about 22km, often close to the 
shore concentrates the island’s plankton rich water that attracts Blue Whales. 
This makes Sri Lanka one of the best places to observe ocean giants.

2.description-Sri Lanka’s coastal waters are a marine biologist’s delight.
 Not only is its waters frequented by Blue Whales for several months of the year,
 it also attracts super pods of Spinner Dolphins, a very common sight. The oceanic
 waters surrounding Sri Lanka are rich in nutrients and therefore attract the bigger
 and more impressive marine giants.

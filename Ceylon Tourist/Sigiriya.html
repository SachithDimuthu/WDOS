            <h3>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress and palace built by King Kashyapa during the reign 
                of 473 – 495 which is standing majestically 660 feet straight up. It is located in the
                 northern Matale district near the town of Dambulla in central province of Sri Lanka. 
                The word Sigiriya or the Sinhagiri means the Lion’s Rock where you have to climb up 1200 
                steps before you reach the Lion Rock Fortress on top of Sigiriya.</h3>

            <h3>History of Sigiriya Rock Fortress </h3>
            <p>Historical research carried out at the site has brought to light evidence to show that
                the origins of Sigiriya date back to pre-historic times. Situated at the base of the 
               Sigiriya rock of its eastern side, is a monadnock named Aligala (Elephant Rock). In a 
               cave underneath this, excavation have revealed remains of pre-historic human settlements
                that existed here around 5,500 years B.P. In addition, there is evidence of 
               human habitation in this area, as far back in history as the 9th — 10th centuries B.C. </p>

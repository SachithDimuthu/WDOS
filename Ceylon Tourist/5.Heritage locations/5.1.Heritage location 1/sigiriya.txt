History of Sigiriya Rock Fortress 
Historical research carried out at the site has brought to light evidence to show that
 the origins of Sigiriya date back to pre-historic times. Situated at the base of the 
Sigiriya rock of its eastern side, is a monadnock named Aligala (Elephant Rock). In a 
cave underneath this, excavation have revealed remains of pre-historic human settlements
 that existed here around 5,500 years B.P. In addition, there is evidence of 
human habitation in this area, as far back in history as the 9th — 10th centuries B.C.

            <h3>Travel to Kandy</h3>
            <p>The Temple of the Tooth is the Temple of the Tooth where the left tooth relic of the Supreme Buddha now resides. The present Temple of the Tooth is located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. During the Kandyan period (1592 to 1815) it was located in the then existing royal palace complex. The Temple of the Tooth was first built by King Wimaladharmasuriya I (1592-1604). The Temple of the Tooth built by him was destroyed by the Portuguese invaders. The present two storied dwelling was built by King Sri Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe (1707 - 1739). Later, even the Nayakkar dynasty of Tamil kings improved and protected the Temple of the Tooth. The city of Kandy where the Temple of the Tooth is located has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>
